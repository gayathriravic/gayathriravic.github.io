					         There is a
need for a portable text reader that is affordable, portable and readily available to the community. We propose a camera based
framework built on the Raspberry Pi, integrated with Image processing algorithms, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and
Text to Speech (TTS) synthesis module. The camera module is used to capture an image of the printed text, and the image is then
subject to pre-processing before being fed into the OCR. The pre-processing stage includes binarization, de-noising, de-skewing,
segmentation and feature extraction. This paper addresses the integration of a complete Text Read-out system designed for the
visually challenged. The OCR used in this project is Google Tesseract and the TTS employed is Pico.

<p class="item-intro text-muted" style="font-size: 14px">
                           The system consists of a camera interfaced with raspberry pi which accepts
a page of printed text. The proposed system is simulated using OpenCV
software. OCR is used to perform image to text conversion. A sample
image converted with each pixel by pixel and pixels are converted to binary,
and are then subject to de-skewing, thresholding, segmentation and feature
extraction. Controller coding for the Raspberry pi is done through Python
language. The audio output is obtained after the captured image is converted
to text, through the help of a TTS synthesizer. Raspberry pi has an audio port
where the output can be heard through the headphone or the speaker

		<h4 style="color:white;"> <p> a. Binarization </p> </h4>
<xmp>
def binarize(): binarize 
(i) Convert the image to grayscale and flip the foreground and background
to ensure foreground is now ”white” and the background is
”black”
(ii) Threshold the image setting all foreground pixels to 255 and background
pixels to 0
(iii) grab the (x, y) coordinates of all pixel values that are greater than
zero, then use these coordinates to compute a rotated bounding box that
contains all coordinates
(iv) Return binarized image to rotate()
</xmp> <br><br>

<h4 style="color:white;"> <p> b. Image De-skew </p> </h4>
<xmp> 

def rotate() : de-skew image
(i) The ‘cv2.minAreaRect‘ function returns values in the range [-90,
0); as the rectangle rotates clockwise the returned angle trends to 0 – in
this special case we need to add 90 degrees to the angle.
(ii) Else, just the inverse of the angle to make it positive.
(iii) Rotate the image to de-skew it.
(iv) Draw the correction angle on the image for validation and return
image to denoise()
</xmp>
<br><br>

<h4 style="color:white;"> <p> c. De-noising Image </p> </h4>
<xmp>

def denoise() : de-noise image
(i) Apply global threshold.
(ii) Apply Otsus threshold.
(iii) Apply Gaussian Blur
(iv) Return de-noised image to segmentation()

<h4 style="color:white;"> <p> c. Text Segmentation </p> </h4>
<xmp>
def segmentation() : segment text in image
(i) Apply Adaptive Threshold.
(ii) Apply dilation and erosion to join the gaps.
(iii) Find contours in the image.
(iv) For each contour, draw a bounding rectangle around it.

<h3 style="color:white;"><p>8. Conclusion </p></h3>
<p class="item-intro text-muted" style="font-size: 14px">
						In this research, we have described a prototype system to read printed text
and hand held objects for assisting blind people. In this research, the camera
acts as input for the paper. As the Raspberry Pi board is powered the camera
starts streaming. When the object for label reading is placed in front of the
camera then the capture button is clicked to provide image to the board. The
detected image is pre-processed before sending to the OCR Engine. Using
Tesseract library the image will be converted into data and the data detected
from the image will be shown on the status bar. The obtained data will be
pronounced through the ear phones using festival TTS Synthesis.
The future scope of this project is promising. OCR Technologies can
be applied to a number of applications such as invoice imaging, banking,
optical music recognition, automatic number recognition, etc. The current
system works for both Hindi and English scripts, however, we plan to extend
these functionalities for other regional Indian scripts (e.g., Tamil, Kannada)
in the near future.
