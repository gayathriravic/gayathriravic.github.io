					         Owing to rapid urbanization and population growth, there is a  pressing need for an optimized traffic control system that minimizes delays. The crux of this problem lies in the challenge of harmonizing behavior between traffic signals to achieve the common goal of reduced network delay. The efficient red and green signal times are determined by a known fitness function of a genetic algorithm. The major part in this work is concerned with applying genetic algorithms to find optimized scheduling solutions for efficient traffic flow. Genetic algorithms are introduced in the system to provide an intelligent green interval response based on the vehicular count.

                           A simulator generated the fitness
function, expressed as the signal settings, which was
iteratively fed back to the genetic algorithm. Each approach
made use of a green period and a red period. Chromosomes
described the behavior of n traffic controllers. The first step
was to compute optimal signal settings. The genetic search
operators: Reproduction, Crossover and mutation were applied
for the purpose of calculation of the fitness function. The
analysis of data indicates that GA is best in finding near optimum.

The graph denotes the fitness function of the offspring at each
generation. At each iteration of the algorithm ie, the fitness is
calculated and the bar graph is plotted. The bar graph
illustrates the change in the fitness over time. We can see the
fitness being optimized over the course of time.
